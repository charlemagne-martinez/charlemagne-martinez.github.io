<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
<p>My name's Charlemagne, but you can call me Char if you want. I'm a SEEEENIIIOOOORRR. I would say that I am a pretty studious person, and I can be shy at times. Some things that I do/enjoy include taekwondo, playing the trumpet (band), listeneing to music, as well as eating (because who doesn't like eating?? I'm sorry, that was bad). Some other things about me is that I like the brand Converse and I enjoy playing video games. Oh wait, I almost forgot. In my freetime, I enjoy sleeping (which is something I don't always get enough of). That's pretty a short summary of me. (okay thank you for your time)

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>This is probably all boring so you can just pass this section (okay thank you).</strong></p>   
    
<h1> Here's some pictures/videos if you got tired of reading my bio (I don't blame you, it's pretty boring. P.S. scroll to the bottom) </h1>
