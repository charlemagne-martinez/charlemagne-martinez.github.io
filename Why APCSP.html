<h1>Why did I decide to take AP Computer Science Principles? </h1>
    <p>There were quite a few reasons why I decided to take APCSP. The first reason is that I heard that taking this course would be easy. BUT...... while doing this webpage project, things haven't seemed that way. Secondly, I decided to take this course because I wanted to see if this field was one that I'd be interested in going into. So yeah, that's basically a gist of it. </p>
    
<h1> 
Hopes? Aspirations? Wishes?
</h1>
    <p>By taking this class, I hope to benefit in specific ways. First off, I hope to see if this field is something that I would actually want to go into. Secondly, I hope to see what computer science is about. I have been hearing about computer science a lot lately, but I haven't really understood what the field is about. Likewise, I see this as a major in many of the college mail, etc. that I get but I don't really know what it's all about. Hopefully, as I go through this course, I'll see if I would enjoy being in this field/career area as well as gain more knowledge about it. </p>
